## Assignment

This first phase of UOCD was all about cultivating your curiosity as you explored the ins-and-outs of your people group. So for this first post, **share a story of when you were surprised on a user visit**. In particular, your post should include:

1. What happened,

2. Why it happened (e.g., why were you surprised?),

3. Why future UOCD students should care about this story (e.g., what can other designers learn from your experience?), and

4. A cover image that represents your post visually (this could be from your visits, a sketch of your own, a photo/picture you found online with an appropriate reference, etc. If you need help getting started on this part, check out the examples or sites like www.unsplash.com (Links to an external site.) or www.thenounproject.com (Links to an external site.))

The post should be between 1-2 written pages and the exact structure/format is up to you.

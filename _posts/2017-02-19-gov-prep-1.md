# Guiding mantra

* Know your audience, and have a purpose. Purposeless presentations are stupid

* Say a few things, and say them well

* Make your points indirectly at least once, use the venue of a project presentation as an excuse

* Get advice from people

    * Nathan and Emily

    * Mark

    * MarCom

# Our audience

State legislators in the education space

Haven't seen or experienced Olin before

Usually don't see passionate and excited students?

# Potential themes to communicate

* Failure is *really* OK.

    * We failed

    * All Olin projects fail

    * Would rather fail than under-scope

* Student choice is important

* Being able to find tools >> having tools

    * Alternate: non-traditional tools are useful

* Olin is awesome! Get Hyped!

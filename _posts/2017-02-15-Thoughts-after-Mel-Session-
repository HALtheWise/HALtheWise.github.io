# Thoughts after Mel Session #1

## Cool framings

Dreyfus Mastery Model

* Mastery is best measured by your ability to vavigate the space. 

* This is a one-dimensional scale that applies to all disciplines, even very abstract ones

Methods of helping people

* Model (the behavior while explaining your internal thoughts)

* Coach (them as they do the behavior)

* Articulate (they explain what they do as they do it)

* (You explain what they do as they do it)

* Bound (they propose attacking one part of the problem at a time)

* Scaffold (you propose attacking one part of the problem at a time)

## Things to do

Self-efficacy

* Help them understand how much they have done

* Do this at upcomming checkins

Observe cognitive capacity limits (working on too many problems at once)

* Induces both cognitive and emotional strain

Promote and take advantage of near peer status.

* Esp. me during Mod2 NINJA interactions, I am weak too!

* Tell stories of me last year

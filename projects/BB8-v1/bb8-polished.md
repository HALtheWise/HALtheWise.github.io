The BB8 project is the result of an open-ended assignment from the Quantitative Engineering Analysis class that I took in Fall 2016. 
It is a self-balancing robot built on rigorous control-system analysis and custom numerical simulation, with an efficient integrated mechanical and electrical design on top.

# Results
After six weeks of work, this project was an **unqualified** **success**. We completed...
- A complete **mathematical** and **numerical** **analysis** of the planar system
- Stable and reliable hardware **implementing** that control system
- A numerical analysis of the nonlinear 3D system

We were invited to present our process and results at the Olin Expo VIP breakfast, and will soon be presenting to a group of Massachussets legislators, including the current Senate Majority Leader, Stan Rosenburg.

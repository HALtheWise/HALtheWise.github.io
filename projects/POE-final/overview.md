In POE (Fall 2016), our team decided to take on the task of building a high-reliability telepresence robot
to live in Olin's library and allow guests to remotely explore Olin's campus.
While we were able to demonstrate a compelling product on the final day of class, the inherent complexities
of producing a sufficiently robust system prevented it from seeing long-term use.

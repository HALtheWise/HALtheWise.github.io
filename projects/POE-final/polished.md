POE is a class that challenges teams of 3-5 students to create a device with sophisticated mechanical, electrical, and software components in nine weeeks. 
Eye-Robot an internet-controlled telepresence robot capable of navigating **human-scale** **spaces** and designed to **interact** **comfortably** with people.
Many different disciplines came together to make this work, with the software and electrical systems being primarily of my design.

# Results
After six weeks of work, this project was a **partial** **success**. We completed...
- Three **major** **iterations** of the mechanical design
- Realtime video and command streaming over the internet using **WebRTC** 
- **Aesthetic** and **UX** **design** to enable comfortable human interaction

Because of time and budget limitations, Eye-robot never reached a high enough reliability for it to exist as a long-term installation on the Olin campus, which was our origional goal. Nevertheless, our team is proud of what we created, and the things we learned along the way.

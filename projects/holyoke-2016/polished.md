Piano Piano Revolution is game, created over a 18-hour period in November 2016, that uses a Leap Motion as a controller for an interactive game experience written in Python.

# Results
In just 18 hours of work, we went from nothing to...
- A fully-fabricated laser-cut acrylic structure allowing the Leap Motion to see hand motion
- A digitally controllable lighting system using FTIR illumination
- An audiovisual game built on the keyboard


Of the more that 20 teams at HackHolyoke, we won the first place overall award, recognizing both the ingenuity of our idea and the technical qualities of the implementation.

As my first hackathon ever, that was a satisfying result for me.
